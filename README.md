# Assembly_Calling_Conventions
This project utilizes the Nios II application binary interface (API) to make function calls in assembly and C. The importance of calling conventions such as callee and caller saved registers are exhibited. Buffer overflows and their consequences were also explored. The first function takes in two arguments and returns the sum. Simple enough, huh? Next we implement an op_three function in assembly that inputs three 32-bit inputs a, b, and c based on the operation of a given mathematical operation called op_two. That operation is unknown, emphasizing the importance of using proper conventions. Lastly, a function implementing the fibonacci sequence up to the input, n, is shown. As for buffer overflows, a C program taking name inputs to output a student's grade is simulated to exhibit how buffer overflows can be used to take advantage of a program with an understanding of assembly.
